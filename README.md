<p align=center>This is a semi-automated youtube bot which allows users to upload multiple videos in bulk, eliminating the need for manual uploading one video at a time. This saves significant time and effort, especially for channels with frequent content releases. The bot offers a scheduling feature that enables users to specify the interval between each video upload. Users have the flexibility to set specific intervals between video uploads according to their channel's requirements.</p>
